        <h1> Grandview Healthcare Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Manitoba Community Healthcare Advocacy Group </h2>
        <p>
          Grandview Healthcare Solutions, established in 2017, grew out of a
          community response from Grandview and Tootinaowaziibeeng Treaty
          Reserve to maintain the Grandview Emergency Medical Services station
          as an essential service of the local healthcare system for both
          communities and surrounding areas. The role of the group has expanded
          to advocate that the Grandview District Hospital be maintained as an
          acute care facility with 24/7 Emergency Service. The group promotes
          keeping Healthcare close to home in rural Manitoba and supports the
          Grandview Healthcare model as a viable system, essential for the
          health of all community members.
